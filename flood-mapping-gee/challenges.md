# Overview

Once you have completed 'Mapping Flooded Areas using SAR', keep that script open and review the following challenges. Work on whichever challenges are interesting to you. Collaborate with your colleagues and your instructors. Happy Coding! 

## Challenge 1
Spend a little more time collecting more reference polygons (maybe even refining existing ones). Can we boost our class-specific accuracies?

## Challenge 2
Refine the map stratification - can you come up with other map classes that would be useful instead of the one provided? 

## Challenge 3
Using your trained classifier, classify several SAR observations in succession for a short time period in an area you are familiar with. See if you can visualize a pattern in open water or flooded vegetation. 

*Tip*: Remember `.map()`? This would be a great use for it. The last block of code could easily be converted into a function with which to map over another S1 SAR collection.
