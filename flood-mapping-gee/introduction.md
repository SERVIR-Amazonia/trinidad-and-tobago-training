# Introduction

Welcome to Flood Mapping Using Multiple Sensors! This workshop contains multiple hands on Google Earth Engine case studies. We will cover the use spectral indices for surface water extraction, and a flooded land cover classification workflow. 

## Pre-workshop Set-up
1. Ensure you are logged into your Google Earth Engine account.
2. Click this link to accept the trinidad-tobago GEE script repository - https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/kwoodward/trinidad-tobago


## Objectives
1. Understand the general process for filtering image collections, creating composites and indices, and training a classification model using collected data.
2. Adapt the provided workflow for a different area of interest and time period
3. Experiment with different ways to improve accuracy of your classification
