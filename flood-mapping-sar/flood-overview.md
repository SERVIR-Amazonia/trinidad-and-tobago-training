## Flood events overview

A flood is a temporary overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Flooding is the most common disaster affecting humankind and provoking several consequences such as infrastructure destruction, crop-plantation loss, electric power outages, disruption of transportation services, landslides, etc. There are different types of floods:
pluvial floods: they are the product of intense rainfall, monsoon rains, or snowmelt
fluvial floods: they result from riverine flooding and overbank flow
storm surge floods: they happen in coastal zones due to winds and sea wave activities
overflow of dams or water reservoirs
