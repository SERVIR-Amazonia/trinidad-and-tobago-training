# Introduction

Welcome to Time Series Change Detection 1. In this workshop, we will seek to understand how a time series of imagery can be used to detect and classify change. We will learn how to use LandTrendr to detect landscape changes over a longer period of time from Landsat imagery. 

**Pre-workshop Setup**

1. Click this link to accept a new script repository: [https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/kwoodward/caribbean-trainings](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/kwoodward/caribbean-trainings). 

2. Slides from today are in the Resources page of this website and also linked here: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YPY0MzGYcraMQOmlPv2PP_ibPjMQh9bT/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115564508851028065035&rtpof=true&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YPY0MzGYcraMQOmlPv2PP_ibPjMQh9bT/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115564508851028065035&rtpof=true&sd=true)

**Objectives**

1. Understand generally what a pixel-based imagery time series is and why it is useful for change detection
2. Gain exposure to several time series change detection algorithms
3. Get hands-on practice running LandTrendr using the LandTrendr GUI adapted for the Caribbean.
