# Introduction

Welcome to Mangrove Mapping Using Multiple Sensors! This workshop will demonstrate a Random Forest classification mapping workflow using Landsat data. We will cover Image Collection filtering, merging, pre-processing steps, and finally, Random Forest model training, classification and accuracy assessment.

## Pre-workshop Set-up
1. Ensure you are logged into your Google Earth Engine account.
2. Click this link to accept the trinidad-tobago GEE script repository
3. Open the script named 'Mangroves Classification - Landsat'
4. Create a new script file - name it whatever you want. This will be your copy of the 'Mangroves Classification - Landsat' script.

## Objectives
1. Understand the general process for training and applying a model in Google Earth Engine on satellite data
2. Adapt the provided workflow for a different area of interest and time period
3. Experiment with different ways to improve accuracy of your classification
